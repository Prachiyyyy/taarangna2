    <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>
    <h2><p>
        Taarangana, the annual cultural fest of IGDTUW (formerly IGIT), is the cultural fest of the only Women Technical University of India. The cultural fest over two days hosts a wide array of enthusiastic students who indulge in myriad activities to display and dabble with their creativity.
    </p>
<p>Taarangna isnt just a cultural event, its a whole emotion made possible by the hard work, creativity and genius of the amazing students at igdtuw. The girls at igdtuw hold special powers, you might think after you come to this event cuz how can just students?? inexperienced in the world of planning and event organising learn to organise such a massive event in just a few days? "Simply amazing", as the few guests quoted. Yes, that's tarangana, simply amazing</p></h2>
<p><h3>When igdtuw's name comes to the mind of people you might think that this girls only college is filled with girls who care only about studeis, afterall the selection criteria of jee does require us to study our brains off. People leave with different opinion about us after visiting the events organised by the team of taarangna. They think of us as extraordinary, multi talented ladies who excel not just in studies and technology but much more.
    Taarangna organises a lot more, not just the biggest fest of the year but various events and programs exclusively for the students of igdtuw throughout the year.
